In order to run the notebook you'll need to place the Divvy_Trips_2013.csv and Divvy_Stations_2013.csv files in the
./Divvy_Stations_Trips_2013 folder.  I don't have space in my account currently to do so myself.  Let me know if this creates
issues.  All other data is already included or is downloaded from the web.
